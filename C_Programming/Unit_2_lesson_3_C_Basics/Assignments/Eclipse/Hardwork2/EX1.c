/*
 * EX1: Write C Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd
 *
 * The program idea
 * Numbers perfectly divisible by 2 are known even numbers and numbers which are not divisible by 2are called odd numbers. This program takes an integer from user and checks whether that number is even or odd and displays the result.
 * Output 1
 * Enter an integer you want to check: 25
 * 25 is odd.
 * Output 2
 * Enter an integer you want to check: 12
 * 12 is even.
